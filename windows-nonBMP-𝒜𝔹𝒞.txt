Here's a nasty one: it has 𝒜𝔹𝒞 in it, which is:

U+1D49C MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL A
U+1D539 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL B
U+1D49E MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL C

Also, trying to select these characters in the Windows 10 file explorer
sometimes left me with *incorrect* UTF-16, as it appears it managed
to select only one character from a surrogate pair at times. Tsk, tsk, Microsoft!
